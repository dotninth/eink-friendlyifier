## üöÄ Introduction

**E-ink Friendlyier** is a _User Script_ designed to adapt websites for e-ink screens. This script also adds page up and page down buttons for animation-free scrolling.

I initially used the [einkbro](https://github.com/plateaukao/einkbro) browser. But the latest versions stopped working reliably on my [Onyx Boox](https://www.boox.com/), and eventually, the browser stopped working altogether.

So, I installed Via. This browser supports adding scripts compatible with _Greasemonkey_, _Tampermonkey_, etc. And that's how **E-ink Friendlyier** was created.

Besides adapting website colors, this user script also attempts to make all interactive elements, like links and buttons, clearly visible.

```

5. Click "OK" and confirm the script installation.

6. Reload the page you were on to see the script working.

### Greaseemonkey, Tampermonkey, etc

To install the script in _Greasemonkey_, _Tampermonkey_, or similar browser extensions:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotninth/eink-friendlyifier/refs/heads/main/userscript.js
